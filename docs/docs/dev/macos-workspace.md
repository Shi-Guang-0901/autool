## Auto screen layout
- **Function**: split the screen into two windows in one click
- In this example, we split the screen into two parts, one for the browser on the left and the other for the terminal on the right. 

## Monitor battery level
- **Function**: limit the maximum battery level to 80% and then stop charging. Remind users to shutdown the computer when the battery level is lower than 20%

- **Note**: the main purpose is to protect the battery from overcharging or over-discharging, which is harmful to the battery lifetime.

## Keep screen awake
- **Function**: shake the mouse every 60s to keep the screen awake all the time until the script is stopped

- **Note**: this is a stupid script to keep the screen always awake, because I am too lazy to change the system settings back and forth.

## Track screen time

## Screen recorder
- **Function**: start QuickTime screen recorder to capture in one click

## Goto fake OS update screen
- **Function**: open

- **Note**: 

## Macro record and replay
